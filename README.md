#🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created as a part of my revision to strengthen my foundational concepts in web development, especially focusing on JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Structure and layout of the game UI

CSS – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript – Game logic, interaction, and DOM updates

🎯 Features
Interactive UI to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors

Random computer move generation

Instant result display: Win, Lose, or Draw

Score tracking and game reset functionality

Visual feedback with color or animation (if applicable)

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Practiced core JavaScript concepts: conditions, functions, event listeners

Improved understanding of HTML structure and semantic elements

Applied CSS for layout, styling, and minor transitions

Manipulated the DOM dynamically based on user interaction
